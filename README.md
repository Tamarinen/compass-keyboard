# Compass Keyboard

Around 2003, I owned a Nokia phone, and became somewhat fed up with multitap and T9.
There had to be a better way to enter text on a numeric keypad!

Using a 3x3 grid, with each key representing a palette of 3x3 characters, one would
be able to enter 81 characters using only two taps. No special combinations, no long
presses, just two taps for each character. Unfortunately, I could not try it in
practice, as my phone wasn't programmable.

In 2005, I got hold of a Sony Ericsson K750i, and had a Java test applet made. Two-tap
worked reasonably well, but I never went further with the concept.

Touch-screen phones came along. Small screens, on-screen keyboards with really small,
virtual keys. The two-tap experiment lingered in my mind, but I didn't take the time
to create a virtual keyboard using the concept. Now, I wanted something reasonably
small, yet able to produce all characters needed for programming and handling GNU
screen via SSH, preferably taking advantage of the gestures made possible by touch
screens, rather than 3x3 grid keyboards, and not requiring too much precision to handle.
There are a few attempts at providing this, including support built into ConnectBot,
but nothing even close to a full, physical keyboard.

In 2019, I stumbled on Compass Keyboard. Several of the underlying concepts were spot
on, and this is my Android learning project, combining the keyboard experiment with
the task of porting an application built for Android 2.2 to Android 9. There are
differences.
